# MIT Emergent Talent Foundation Track Assignment - Group 12

Welcome to the repository for **Group 12**'s assignment as part of the MIT Foundation
Track. This repository represents our collaborative effort to explore, learn, and
apply essential skills in software development through the implementation of a
**calculator project**. Each member of the team is contributing unique functionalities
to the calculator, reviewing each otherâ€™s code, and refining the project as a group.

## Project Overview

This repository serves as the final deliverable for the Foundation Track, showcasing
our teamwork and dedication to mastering foundational concepts in software development.
Our primary objective is to collaboratively design and develop a calculator, with
every team member contributing to its various functionalities.

As a team of **10 emerging talents**, we are working together to:

- Implement different features of the **calculator project**, including basic arithmetic,
advanced functions, and more.
- Collaborate on code reviews to ensure high quality and maintainability.
- Utilize **Git** for version control and collaboration.
- Navigate and manage projects effectively on **GitHub** using issues, pull requests,
and project boards.
- Adhere to **test-driven development (TDD)** cycles to ensure robust and reliable
code.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Version Control**: Git, integrated with GitHub
- **Editor**: Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with extensions to enhance productivity
- **Collaboration**: GitHub issues, pull requests, and project boards
