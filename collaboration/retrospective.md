# Retrospective - Yevheniia Rudenko

Below are things I will stop doing moving forward:

- Working without a clear schedule and relying on daily availability instead of
following a structured plan.

Below are things I will start/continue doing moving forward:

- Following a more precise schedule to maintain better structure in my work.
- Ensuring clear and proactive communication with the team when I encounter
challenges or misunderstandings.
- Continuing to meet milestones and internal deadlines while
collaborating effectively with the team.

Reflection:
Having a structure, even a relative one, proved to be very important for our
team. Milestones kept us on track, and we successfully achieved them together.
Teamwork can be incredibly productive and educational, especially when you can
rely on your teammates for help. Effective communication is the key to success.
