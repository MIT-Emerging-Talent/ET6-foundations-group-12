# Retrospective  

This document represents the retrospective for our Team Project, created by
Group 12. Below, you will find individual retrospectives
from each team member, reflecting on their experiences,
lessons learned, and areas for improvement.  

The structure and plan for this retrospective were initially proposed to us as
a guide to help each participant conduct their own reflection. While this
structure is not mandatory, it was created to assist in organizing thoughts in
a consistent and professional manner. You can review the suggested structure
below, which we followed to provide clarity and coherence in our reflections.  

---

## Retrospective Structure

### Key Reflection Topics

- Stop Doing  
- Continue Doing  
- Start Doing  
- Lessons Learned  

### Strategy vs. Board - Key Questions for Reflection

- What parts of your plan went as expected?  
- What parts of your plan did not work out?  
- Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?  
- Or remove extra steps?  

By following this structured approach, we aimed to capture valuable insights
from each participant while maintaining a professional and organized
presentation of our reflections. This document not only serves as a
summary of our achievements and challenges but also as a foundation
for improving our workflows and collaboration in future projects.

- Being more flexible and open to suggestions or changes proposed by the team.  

A lot didn't go as planned üòè but what I learnt is teamwork always wins

# Retrospective - Yevheniia Rudenko

Below are things I will stop doing moving forward:

- Working without a clear schedule and relying on daily availability instead of
following a structured plan.

Below are things I will start/continue doing moving forward:

- Following a more precise schedule to maintain better structure in my work.
- Ensuring clear and proactive communication with the team when I encounter
challenges or misunderstandings.
- Continuing to meet milestones and internal deadlines while
collaborating effectively with the team.

Reflection:
Having a structure, even a relative one, proved to be very important for our
team. Milestones kept us on track, and we successfully achieved them together.
Teamwork can be incredibly productive and educational, especially when you can
rely on your teammates for help. Effective communication is the key to success.

## What I will stop doing  

Honestly, there‚Äôs nothing that I feel I need to stop doing. I‚Äôve been intentional
about my approach to this project, and it‚Äôs been going great. For example, my
structured Git workflow, regular communication with the team, and consistent contributions
to reviews have all been effective. I‚Äôve also learned the importance of balancing
quality and efficiency, and these efforts are paying off.  

## What I will continue doing

- **Collaborative Reviews:** I‚Äôve been actively reviewing my teammates‚Äô work and
offering constructive feedback, and I will continue doing this because it improves
the overall quality of our code.  
- **Clear Git Workflow:** I‚Äôve been following a structured Git workflow by creating
branches, committing regularly, and writing detailed pull requests. I will stick
to this because it‚Äôs been very effective.  
- **Team Support:** I‚Äôve been fostering open discussions and supporting my teammates,
and I will keep doing this because it helps us work better as a team.  

## What I will start doing  

- **Regular Check-ins:** I plan in future projects to suggest having more frequent
check-ins with the team to stay aligned and track our progress more effectively.
- **Automated Testing:** I want to start incorporating more automated testing into
my workflow to catch potential errors early and ensure our code is reliable.  

## The lessons that I have learned  

- **Importance of Communication:** I‚Äôve learned how crucial it is to communicate
effectively with my team. Misunderstandings can lead to delays, so I now focus on
being clear and concise.  
- **Value of Feedback:** I‚Äôve realized how valuable it is to receive and give constructive
feedback during code reviews. It‚Äôs helped me grow and write better code.  
- **Patience with Learning:** I‚Äôve also learned that it‚Äôs okay to take time to fully
understand new tools or techniques instead of rushing through them.

## The parts of my plan that went as expected

I found that my structured Git workflow and clear communication for pull requests
worked as I had planned. These practices helped me stay organized and complete tasks
efficiently.  

## The parts of my plan that did not work out  

There wasn‚Äôt anything that didn‚Äôt work out in the overall sense. The general track
of the project went exactly the way I planned it. Although the process involved
trying things out, and some of these didn‚Äôt work, that was all part of the learning
experience. Each trial added to my understanding and contributed to the success of
the project.

## Things that I added that weren't in my initial strategy  

I had to include more detailed documentation for my work after realizing it
might not be clear enough for my teammates during reviews.

# Retrospective - Zephaniah Okoye

## What I will refrain from doing

- **Delaying Communication**: Avoid waiting too
   long before seeking help or clarifying doubts.
- **Ignoring Time Management**: Stop neglecting the
   importance of a structured schedule.
- **Working in Isolation**: Avoid working on tasks
   without collaborating with teammates.

## What I will keep doing

- **Collaborative Efforts**: Maintain active
  participation in team discussions and code reviews.
- **Structured Workflow**: Continue following a clear
   Git workflow and maintaining organized commit histories.
- **Proactive Communication**: Keep communicating progress
   and challenges regularly with the team.

## What I will commence doing

- **Regular Check-Ins**: Implement more frequent check-ins with
   the team to ensure alignment and track progress.
- **Automated Testing**: Incorporate more automated testing
  into the development workflow to enhance code reliability.
- **Detailed Documentation**: Start adding more comprehensive
   documentation to ensure clarity for teammates during reviews.

## What went well

- **Team Collaboration**: The team worked together effectively,
  leading to timely completion of tasks and high-quality output.
- **Code Reviews**: Constructive feedback during code
  reviews significantly improved the code quality.
- **Communication**: Regular and clear communication helped in
   resolving issues quickly and maintaining progress.
- **Seeking Help**: My ability to ask for help from teammates both
   privately and on the Slack general communication platform was a lifesaver.

## What could have been improved

- **Time Management**: More structured scheduling could have
   helped in meeting deadlines more efficiently.
- **Early Testing**: Integrating automated testing earlier in
  the development process could have caught potential issues sooner.
- **Documentation**: More detailed documentation from the beginning
   would have provided better clarity for team members.

## Lessons gleaned from my experience

- **Importance of Teamwork**: Collaboration and clear
   communication are key to project success.
- **Effective Feedback**: Constructive feedback during code
  reviews helps improve code quality and personal growth.
- **Time Management**: A well-structured schedule enhances
  productivity and ensures timely completion of tasks.
- **Continuous Learning**: It's crucial to stay updated with
  new tools and techniques and to be patient with the learning process.
