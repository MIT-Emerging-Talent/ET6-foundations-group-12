Below are things I will stop doing moving forward

- Waste time instead of asking for help.  
- Overlooking the importance of consistent communication with teammates.  

Below are things I will start/continue doing moving forward

- Breaking tasks into smaller steps.  
- Be available to help  
- Proactively communicating progress with teammates
- Being more flexible and open to suggestions or changes proposed by the team.  

A lot didn't go as planned üòè but what I learnt is teamwork always wins
