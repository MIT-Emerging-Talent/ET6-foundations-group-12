# Retrospective - Yevheniia Rudenko

Below are things I will stop doing moving forward:

- Working without a clear schedule and relying on daily availability instead of
following a structured plan.

Below are things I will start/continue doing moving forward:

- Following a more precise schedule to maintain better structure in my work.
- Ensuring clear and proactive communication with the team when I encounter
challenges or misunderstandings.
- Continuing to meet milestones and internal deadlines while
collaborating effectively with the team.

Reflection:
Having a structure, even a relative one, proved to be very important for our
team. Milestones kept us on track, and we successfully achieved them together.
Teamwork can be incredibly productive and educational, especially when you can
rely on your teammates for help. Effective communication is the key to success.

## What I will Stop Doing  

Honestly, there‚Äôs nothing that I feel I need to stop doing. I‚Äôve been intentional
about my approach to this project, and it‚Äôs been going great. For example, my
structured Git workflow, regular communication with the team, and consistent contributions
to reviews have all been effective. I‚Äôve also learned the importance of balancing
quality and efficiency, and these efforts are paying off.  

## What I will continue doing

- **Collaborative Reviews:** I‚Äôve been actively reviewing my teammates‚Äô work and
offering constructive feedback, and I will continue doing this because it improves
the overall quality of our code.  
- **Clear Git Workflow:** I‚Äôve been following a structured Git workflow by creating
branches, committing regularly, and writing detailed pull requests. I will stick
to this because it‚Äôs been very effective.  
- **Team Support:** I‚Äôve been fostering open discussions and supporting my teammates,
and I will keep doing this because it helps us work better as a team.  

## What I will start Doing  

- **Regular Check-ins:** I plan in future projects to suggest having more frequent
check-ins with the team to stay aligned and track our progress more effectively.
- **Automated Testing:** I want to start incorporating more automated testing into
my workflow to catch potential errors early and ensure our code is reliable.  

## The lessons that I have learned  

- **Importance of Communication:** I‚Äôve learned how crucial it is to communicate
effectively with my team. Misunderstandings can lead to delays, so I now focus on
being clear and concise.  
- **Value of Feedback:** I‚Äôve realized how valuable it is to receive and give constructive
feedback during code reviews. It‚Äôs helped me grow and write better code.  
- **Patience with Learning:** I‚Äôve also learned that it‚Äôs okay to take time to fully
understand new tools or techniques instead of rushing through them.
